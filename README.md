# Projects
These are projects that I feel exemplify my abilities as a software developer

1. Adjacency Matrix & Adjacency List data structure in java.
this code allows you to create a non linear graph. The user can add nodes and edges and also remove them. It will also find the shortest path between two nodes.
Relationships can be both directional and undirectional.
In this project I learned about graph data structures and ho to program them as well as their uses.

2. The Jetty graph
running a java server on the backend through jetty I am visualising a graph data structure.
Java is using an adjacency matrix to handle the data structure end of things. On the front end
konva.js is used to draw the shapes based on what is typed into the form. this information
then gets posted to the server in order to track the nodes.
In this project I learned more about server side development and full stack development.
I learned to POST to a server and GET from a server. More specifically I also learned how to
setup jetty in Eclipse and use a java server.

This was during the initial test phase of the project when I was creating the front end:

This was when I got the draggable arrows to work and I got the java backend onboard:

3. Cars GUI
A graphical user interface that stores details about cars.
You are allowed to add, remove and list the cars, make, model, registration number, millage and year of manufacture.
In this project I learned to serialise data, use maven and perform Junit testing.
