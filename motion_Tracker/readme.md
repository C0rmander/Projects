This is a motion tracker for bipedal humanoid models in unity.

it uses the arduino to track the movement of the humand body in the real world
and unity reads in the serial port and tracks the data from the arduino to unity.
At the moment it is a proof of concept because I am only track the right shoulder cuff
however it could be expanded and I hope to use D1 mini boards to make the system wireless.

In this project I learned to read the serial port in unity and I learned about programming
specifically a d1 mini and an Esp8266.
